# # ðŸ“Š Data Mining on Sales Dataset

This repository contains one Jupyter Notebook created as part of my data mining practice and learning journey:

* âœ… **Mining Sales Dataset:** Applying data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and mining techniques to discover patterns and trends in sales data.

Just open the notebook `mining-sales-dataset.ipynb` in Jupyter to explore the analysis â€” no setup needed!
